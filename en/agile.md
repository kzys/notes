## Gantt charts

[Why GANTT Charts Were Banned in the First Scrum](https://www.scruminc.com/why-gantt-charts-were-banned-in-first/) (2006)

> Taking the GANTT chart into the Sprint has people look at a planning document that is absolutely wrong after the first day. At best it gobbles up a full time resource in the futile effort to keep the chart up to date. Even worse, it may lead the team to do the wrong thing and lose, i.e. a failed Sprint goes up in flames.

## Criticism

Dave Thomas has written [Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html) in 2014. Ron Jeffries has written about [Dark Scrum](https://ronjeffries.com/categories/dark-scrum/) a lot. Both of them were the authors of [the Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org).

Steve Yagge also has written [Good Agile, Bad Agile](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html) in 2006.
