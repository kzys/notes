# Kindle

I like Kindle. Having international free 3G was mind-blowing and showed me that customer experience is not just about hardware and software. It might be one of the reasons to work for Amazon, although I haven't worked in any Kindle teams though.

That being said, I bought too many Kindle devices. Currently 4 and only one of them is broken.

## Kindle devices I bought

### Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation)

2022-

### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

2016-

### Kindle Paperwhite (6th Generation)

2015-

A replacement for the one below.

### Kindle Paperwhite (6th Generation)

2013-2015

My first Kindle from Amazon.co.jp.

I broke this Kindle's screen when I was visiting Kyoto, contacted Amazon and got a new one with discount.

### Kindle Touch

2012-

Another Kindle from Amazon.com while I was living in Tokyo.

I still have this one, but the screen is now broken.

### Kindle 2

2010-?

I bought this Kindle from Amazon.com while I was living in Tokyo. Kindle wasn't launched in Japan at that time.

I may have lost this Kindle.

## Settings

Although I like Kindle, I don't like Special Offers (because they are ads) and Popular Highlights (because reading alone is the way).
