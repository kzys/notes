My first Kindle from Amazon.co.jp.

I broke this Kindle's screen when I was visiting Kyoto, contacted Amazon and got a new one with discount.

## Kindle Touch

Another Kindle from Amazon.com while I was in Tokyo.

I still have this one, but the screen is now broken.

I bought this Kindle from Amazon.com while I was living in Tokyo. Kindle wasn't launched in Japan at that time.

I may have lost this Kindle.
