# Guitar

I bought Squier's Stratocaster in July 2022. It was one of my Prime Day purchases.

I initially wanted to have an acoustic guitar. It looks simple and more offline. I can play an acoustic guitar even during blackout.

However, apprently electric guitars are slightly easier to play due to the lighter strings. I can play an electric guitar with headphones which is certainly more realistic than playing guitars in blackouts. And most importantly, The music I listened to from 椎名林檎 to Khruangbin to Covet, all of them use electric guitars.

Having a black electric guitar in late 30's may have a bit of mid-crisis vibe to be honest. Who cares!
