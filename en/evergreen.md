# Evergreen notes

I'd like to keep notes in this website mostly up-to-date. Some folks on the Internet call that [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), others call that [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

[Justine Dane](https://www.arcana.computer/about-this-site) has also written;

> I want to do a better job of writing things and thinking about things that don't have creation dates or publication dates. That's what's motivating this site.
