This is an attempt to write and collect notes.
I was blogging for more than a decade.
And the end result was too scattered than what I want.
Unlike blog posts, these notes would be updated after weeks or months.

Put frankly, I want to have something like,
[Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes),
[wh0.github.io](https://wh0.github.io/) and/or
[„Å≤„Åó„Å†„Åæ's „Éõ„Éº„É†„Éö„Éº„Ç∏](https://www.ne.jp/asahi/hishidama/home/index.html).

While I agree that [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI),
I couldn't figure out the way to keep all URLs permanently available.
It may be possible to follow all renames through Git,
but I haven't implemented the idea yet.
