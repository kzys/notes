This is an attempt to write and collect notes like [How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/).

While I agree that [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI), I couldn't figure out the way to keep all URLs permanently available. It may be possible to follow all renames through Git, but I haven't implemented the idea yet.
